        <h2>Analysis of Obesity Rates in Europe</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
              Eastern Europe shows the highest increase in obesity rates over time, starting around 19.8% in 2014 and rising steadily to approximately 31.6% by 2022. This region experiences the most significant growth, indicating a notable trend in rising obesity.
            </li>
            <li>
              Central Europe follows a similar upward trend, starting at around 18.9% in 2014 and reaching close to 28.1% in 2022. This indicates that Central Europe also faces growing obesity rates, though at a slightly slower rate than Eastern Europe.
            </li>
            <li>
              Southern Europe maintains a moderate growth trend, with obesity percentages increasing from 15.3% in 2014 to around 22.8% in 2022. Despite being lower than Eastern and Central Europe, the upward trajectory reflects a gradual increase in obesity.
            </li>
            <li>
              Northern Europe and Western Europe exhibit the lowest overall obesity rates, with comparatively minimal growth over time. Northern Europe rises from about 15.6% in 2014 to 20.3% in 2022, while Western Europe has a slight increase from 17.2% to 19.4% within the same period.
