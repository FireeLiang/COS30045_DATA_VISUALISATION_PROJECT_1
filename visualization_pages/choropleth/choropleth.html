                <h1>Obesity is not about being 'Fat'</h1>

                <p>
                    According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 
                    Obesity is a chronic complex disease where one's health is impaired by excessive fat deposits. 
                    Obesity is the opposite extremity of malnutrition, possibly caused by an imbalanced diet and/or lack of physical activity.
                    Obesity may also be the product of obesogenic environments, psycho-social factors and genetic variants.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Obesity is the onset of multiple diseases and health complications. 
                    The risks of Noncommunicable Diseases (NCDs), such as Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease 
                    and certain types of cancer can be exacerbated by obesity.
                    Bone health and reproduction are also negatively affected by obesity.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For adults, WHO defines properly diagnosed obesity cases as those where a person's Body Mass Index (BMI) 
                    is greater than or equal to 30.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The following chloropleth utilizes data from the WHO, measuring the percentage of obese adults (+18) 
                    in comparison with the population, seperating the data based on gender
                    across the years from 1990 to 2022. Data that is Not Available (N/A) is colored accordingly.
