		<h1>Obesity is not about being <section style="text-decoration: underline;">'Fat'</section></h1>
		<p>
			According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 
			Obesity is a chronic complex disease where one's health is impaired by excessive fat deposits. 
			Obesity is the opposite extremity of malnutrition, possibly caused by an imbalanced diet and/or lack of physical activity.
			Obesity may also be the product of obesogenic environments, psycho-social factors and genetic variants.
			
		</p>
		<p>
			Obesity is the onset of multiple diseases and health complications. 
			The risks of Noncommunicable Diseases (NCDs), such as Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease 
			and certain types of cancer can be exacerbated by obesity.
			Bone health and reproduction are also negatively affected by obesity.
		</p>
		<p>
			For adults, WHO defines properly diagnosed obesity cases as those where a person's Body Mass Index (BMI) 
			is greater than or equal to 30.
		</p>
		<p>
			The following chloropleth utilizes data from the WHO, measuring the percentage of obese adults (+18) 
			in comparison with the population, seperating the data based on gender
			across the years from 1990 to 2022. Data that is Not Available (N/A) is colored accordingly.
